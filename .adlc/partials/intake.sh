# partials/intake.sh — unstructured-source intake helpers for /spec Step 1.4 (REQ-594).
#
# SOURCED, not executed — call sites source this and then call the functions in the
# SAME fenced block, because SKILL.md fenced blocks do not share shell state across
# steps (conventions.md "Bash in skills"; enforced by tools/lint-skills's
# cross-fence-fn check). This is REQ-594 BR-10.
#
# Functions:
#   adlc_intake_detect <args>...  BR-1 trigger check.
#                                 0 = run intake, 1 = ordinary request, skip.
#                                 Exports ADLC_INTAKE_KIND / _PATH / _REASON /
#                                 _INLINE. An inline (pasted) source is written to
#                                 a temp file so _PATH is ALWAYS a real file on the
#                                 intake path; _INLINE=1 marks that case.
#   adlc_intake_segment <path>    Build the delimited, budget-checked corpus.
#                                 0 = ok, 2 = unreadable, 3 = over budget (refusal).
#                                 Exports ADLC_INTAKE_SEGMENTS / _LINES / _CORPUS /
#                                 _SOURCE.
#   adlc_intake_range <n> <total> Print "<start> <end>" for segment n of a <total>-line
#                                 source, so a segment the delegate omitted can be read
#                                 directly from the ORIGINAL source by line offset
#                                 (BR-12). Stateless by design — see its own comment.
#   adlc_intake_redact <path>     Apply the 5-pattern credential chain in place.
#   adlc_intake_sections          Print the gap-checklist section list, derived from
#                                 the requirement template (never hardcoded).
#
# Everything the functions communicate travels through EXPORTED ADLC_INTAKE_* vars,
# never through bare shell variables: tools/lint-skills's cross-fence-var check flags
# a non-exported var assigned in one fence and read in another, and an exported var is
# the sanctioned way to cross that boundary.
#
# POSIX sh only, and must pass under BOTH bash and zsh (partials/tests/run.sh):
#   * no `local` (underscore-prefixed _ai_* globals stand in, as in
#     partials/emit-step-telemetry.sh's _aest_* convention)
#   * no `[[`, no arrays, no `function` keyword, no GNU-only flags
#   * no `\b` in `grep -E` — BSD grep silently fails on it (LESSON-013). Whole-line
#     fixed-string matching uses `grep -vxF` instead.
#   * no variable named `status` — reserved in zsh (LESSON-329)
#   * no unquoted word-splitting for path lists — zsh does not word-split (LESSON-335)
#   * temp files via `mktemp` templates, never a predictable path (LESSON-008)
#
# Sourcing emits nothing on stdout or stderr.
