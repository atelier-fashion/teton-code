## Description

What this task accomplishes.

## Files to Create/Modify

- `path/to/file.js` — description of changes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Verification

<!-- OPTIONAL section (REQ-595). Emitted by /architect Step 4.5; read by
     /validate's obligation-coverage gate. A task file WITHOUT this section is
     still valid — the gate reports the gap as an advisory finding and does not
     block advancement.

     The two rows below are EXAMPLES showing the shape. REPLACE them with this
     task's real obligations, or delete the whole section if the task has
     nothing to declare. Never leave the examples in a real task file: they
     cite rule ids that almost certainly do not mean anything in your REQ, and
     the coverage gate would read them as genuine claims of coverage. -->

| rule | kind | artifact | benign_path |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| BR-1 | structural-check | `tools/lint-skills`: sentinels, balance | no |
| AC-2 | test-case | `path/to/test_file.py::test_case_name` | yes |

- **rule** — `BR-<n>` or `AC-<n>`, referencing the parent REQ. ACs are addressed
  by **1-based ordinal** within the REQ's `## Acceptance Criteria` list, because
  the requirement template does not print AC numbers.
- **kind** — `test-case` | `structural-check`. Closed enum. `dogfood` (invoke the
  skill and inspect artifacts) is deliberately excluded: it cannot report an
  executed-work count, which the vacuous-run gate requires.
- **artifact** — for `test-case`, a test file path plus case name; for
  `structural-check`, the check surface plus the named check(s). Must resolve
  once the task is implemented.
- **benign_path** — `yes` when the obligation includes a **must-not-fire** case.
  Required for any rule describing detection, refusal, or a halt: a detector
  validated only against adversarial input ships broken and passes its own suite.

## Technical Notes

Implementation details, patterns to follow, edge cases.
